#### ⭐️ Star the repo if you like it!
#### Program that allows you to track your strafe performance! Find out if you would benefit from Snap Tap | SOCD.

  ## 📖 How to use
  - Visit the GitHub Pages release [here](https://chat.patrikzudel.me/).
  - Launch the setup and install the program
  - Strafe! 

## ⚡ Features
- Tracking of strafe performance
- Preview of all monitored strafe types - Early, Late and Perfect
## 💬 Reasonings
I initially created this to collect data to advance the discussion on Snap Tap and SOCD.

After Snap Tap was banned, this should mainly serve as a training tool used for improving strafe performance as it provides real-time feedback.

Stack: Rust, Solid.js, Tauri, Tailwind
