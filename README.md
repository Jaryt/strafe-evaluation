  ## 📖 How to use

  - Visit the GitHub Pages release [here](https://github.com/patrikzudel/strafe-evaluation/releases).
  - Launch the setup and install the program.
  - Start the program and strafe! 

## ⚡ Features
- Tracking of strafe performance
- Preview of all monitored strafe types - Early, Late and Perfect
## 💬 Reasonings
I initially created this to collect data to advance the discussion on Snap Tap and SOCD.

After Snap Tap was banned, this should mainly serve as a training tool used for improving strafe performance as it provides real-time feedback. 

## 📖 How it works

Stack: Rust, Solid.js, Tauri, Tailwind
