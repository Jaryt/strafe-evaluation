  ## 📖 How to use

  - Visit the GitHub release page [**here**](https://github.com/patrikzudel/strafe-evaluation/releases).

  - Launch the setup and install the program.

  - Start the program and strafe! 

    - **Late Release** — both keys were pressed for X milliseconds
    - **Early Release** — no keys were pressed for X milliseconds
    - **Perfect strafe** — the strafe was deemed perfect within a 2 millisecond margin of error
    - If you **need help** with understanding what is a **"Early"** or **"Late"** strafe, **click on the buttons next to "A" and "D"**. Clicking a button will trigger an **animation** that showcases each strafe type.

**Note**: The tracking will likely not work while **FACEIT Anti-cheat** is running, they might block the global input tracking.

## ⚡ Features
- Tracking of strafe performance
- Preview animations of all monitored strafe types - Early, Late and Perfect
## 💬 Reasonings
I initially created this to collect data to advance the discussion on Snap Tap and SOCD.

After Snap Tap was banned, this should mainly serve as a training tool used for improving strafe performance as it provides real-time feedback. 

## 📖 How it works

Stack: Rust, Solid.js, Tauri, Tailwind
